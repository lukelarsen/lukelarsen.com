## Pickleball At Home Is Back On

We had to re-surface our pickleball court. You can read about why we had to re-surface the court in the first place [here](/blog/we-have-a-pickleball-court/). The concrete was acid washed, and the court surface material was re-applied. Everything went great. We also had a light installed while we were at it. We did change the gray to green, and we like the look of that. We've missed having the court right here so much. Let the drilling, games, and lessons commence.
