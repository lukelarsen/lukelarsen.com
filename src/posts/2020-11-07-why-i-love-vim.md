## My curiosity was high

I used [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for a long time and had no problems with it. Then I watched a video tutorial about javascript. The teacher wasn't even talking about Vim. I got to see him write code, and I watched him move around in his editor. I was floored. What wizardry is this? That was about 7 years ago.

Since then I have read books, watched videos, re-written my .vimrc over and over, and learned a lot about Vim. People frequently ask me, "Aren't you a UX designer and CSS guy? Why do you use Vim?!" My answer is always the same. It makes me write CSS and other code faster. At first, I was slow, and I made a lot of mistakes. I kept Sublime close at hand for when I need to just get stuff done. Over time though I needed Sublime less and less. You will often hear Vim users tell others to just give it a chance, and after a while, you will want to use Vim everywhere and not just for coding. It is true. I do wish I could use Vim in more places. And yes, if you stick with it, I think most people would love Vim. 

## Other options besides the terminal

### VSCode

I have been using [VSCodeVim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) in VS Code because of this [beautiful VS Code theme](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode). So if you have a theme or a feature that you can't do without, install the VSCodeVim.

Stuff even glows!

### OniVim

I'm excited about the [OniVim project](https://www.onivim.io/). It aims to bring real Vim into an editor like VS Code. We can take all the goodness that comes from VS Code and also use Vim with all its features.
