## What is Masting Vim Quickly

[Masting Vim Quickly](https://jovicailic.org/mastering-vim-quickly/) is a book by Jovica Ilik. I have been using Vim for a number of years and I learned a lot when I got started. I've developed some good habits and some bad ones in Vim. I saw Jovica post a few things in Twitter about Vim and he motivated me to get better at Vim. I signed up for his newletter and I learn something from each newsletter he sends out. I recently bought his book and have been very impressed with the content. It is full of nuggets that have helped me change my Vim habits for the better. If you are totally new to Vim and want to give it a go I highly recommend this book. If you want to learn some new things in Vim this book will also help you do that.
