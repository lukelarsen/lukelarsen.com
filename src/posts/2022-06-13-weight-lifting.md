## Something New

I've always been a little guy. Many times I've been told that I should start to lift some weights and I'd have fun and see some results quickly. I never listened. I hated the gym environment. I didn't like traveling to the gym, and why would I use time doing that when I could play pickleball? But that being said, sometimes I get that itch to try something new. When that feeling comes it's usually related to something web development related, like a new language or a new javascript framework. This time I had the feeling to give lifting weights a try.

### Equipment
I knew I wouldn't go to the gym, so I started looking at home options. I was told I could work out every muscle group with some dumbbells. But getting a set of those was expensive! In my hunt, I discovered adjustable dumbbells. I didn't know that was a thing. I found [an older model of a Weider 55lb adjustable dumbbell](https://www.samsclub.com/p/weider-55lb-select-a-weight-dumbbell-pair/prod25812013) and got it. [The newer model looks like this](https://www.amazon.com/Weider-WEIRDER-Select-Adjustable-Dumbbell/dp/B07G8NDVT2). I picked up [a cheap workout bench on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Z3CD7CV?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) and I was on my way.

### Program
Now I had to find a program to follow. I wanted one easy enough for a beginner but could transition into something more difficult over time. I found [this program](https://thefitnessphantom.com/5-day-dumbbell-workout-split) online. I'm doing program one now and will build up to program three.

### So far so good
I'm two weeks in now, and I like it. I can work at home with no one else around. I don't have to travel. I can start when it's convenient for me. Most importantly, doing this hasn't gotten in the way of pickleball.
