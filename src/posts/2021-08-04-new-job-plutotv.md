## End Of A Chapter
Man, it's hard to think that I'm actually leaving Uplynk (Verizon, Aol, Oath, Verizon Media). I imagined numerous times that I'd stick with this time until the end of my career. That is saying something since before Uplynk I didn't say over 2 years at any company. All the people I worked directly with at Uplynk are absolutely amazing! The projects I got to work on in the streaming world were fun and exciting. I'm glad I got to be part of the work we did. It was an amazing journey.

## So Why Am I Leaving?
To be honest I'm a little unsure about where the future of the company is going. [Verizon sold us to Apollo](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-media-be-acquired-apollo-funds) and it's unsure exactly where they will take the company. I also started to realize just how long I'd been in this position and I started to think about stretching my wings somewhere else. Then I heard about [PlutoTV](https://pluto.tv) and about a position that would be right up my ally. I decided to check it out and that eventually lead to me accepting a position at Pluto TV.

## What Will I Be Doing At PlutoTV
I'll be building an extensive component library from the ground up in React for their internal tools to use. This type of work excites me a lot! I've worked on Bindable off and on over the years while juggling regular work. Now I'll be able to focus all of my time working on and maintaining a component library. I'm really excited. Onward!
