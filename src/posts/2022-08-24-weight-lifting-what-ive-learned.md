## It's Going Good

I was skeptical if I'd stick with this goal. I know that's not the best way to start a new goal. I've just never been excited about weight lifting. I can report, though, that I have learned to enjoy it!

### Progress
It's been 14 weeks since I started lifting. Covid hit me about week 5. I did nothing that week.  So with that, I've worked out 5 days a week for 13 weeks. For the first two weeks, I was incredibly sore! Once that wore off I continue to feel the soreness, but not in a way like the first two weeks. I've kept a log of what exercises I do and how much weight I do. I have been able to increase the weight a little and that feels great.

## Diet
I eat a lot more than I did before. I eat mostly protein. Chicken, greek yogurt, cottage cheese, and beef jerky are some of the things I eat regularly now. It's fun because I now eat with another purpose besides being hungry. I eat to fuel my workout and to help recovery. It's enjoyable.

## Gym
I still don't want to go to the gym. I just use my adjustable dumbbells at home and work out when I have time. I have found this just works for me. If you're interested in the setup I have you can see everything in my [original post](https://www.lukelarsen.com/blog/new-goal:-lift-weights/).
