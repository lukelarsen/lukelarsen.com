## The Subway
[Zion National Park](https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm) is beautiful. It is full of breathtaking hikes. For most of the hikes, you can show up at the park and go. A few you need to get a permit to hike. The Subway hike is one of those. My sister was able to get some permits, so off we went. It isn't a difficult hike, but it is long. It is 9.1 miles in total. You'll want to block off the entire day and back in food and a lot of water. The end of the hike has a pretty steep upward hike. That is the most difficult part of the hike. There are some areas where you can repel if you want. You can also use a rope to help you down the rock. Here are some of the photos from the adventure. I highly recommend visiting Zion National Park if you get the chance.
