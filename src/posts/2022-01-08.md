## Creating Abstract Art with Gradient Blurs
I've always enjoyed created abstract art with code or design tools. Adobe has gotten expensive over the years. A great alternative to Photoshop that I've been using for a while is [Pixelmator](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/). They [posted a little video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By7XGcpJAJ4) recently with a cool technique for creating some nice gradient effects. I like this kind of stuff because I like to use custom backgrounds for my watch and phone. Here are a few I've created following this technique.
