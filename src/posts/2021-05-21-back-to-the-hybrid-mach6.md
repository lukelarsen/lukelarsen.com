## Hybrid vs Power
After a few months of using the [Power version of the Mach6](https://www.selkirk.com/products/vanguard-power-mach6), I have decided that the Power version isn't for me. At least not right now. It might be later in my pickleball journey when I get more experience. Right now, the touch and control that I get from the [Hybrid](https://www.selkirk.com/products/vanguard-hybrid-mach6) version is something I can't pass up. The Hybrid model seems to absorb a lot of the ball so I can control where I place it on the court. The Power version gave me a lot of added power and was quite useful, but when I got in tricky situations where I needed to reset, the Hybrid did it for me. I'll get better at resetting and the soft game and give the Power version another try later down the road.

## Selkirk is amazing
I need to give a quick shout-out to [Selkrik](https://selkrik.com). They have superb customer experience and have always been a pleasure to work with. I can't recommend them enough!
