## No stick shirts!
I'm on the pickleball court a lot. Sometimes six times a week. The weather where I live is very hot. In the summer we get over 100 every day. I usually play in the early mornings or later at night. In the winter I'll play during the day. Why am I bringing all this up? Well, I sweat a lot when playing. A lot of the athletic shirts I have used will stick to me because of the sweat. It is a  pet peeve to have my shirts pulling at me while chasing down a ball. I've got three Selkirk shirts, and I reach for them all the time because they don't stick. They breathe and help keep me cool. They also look fantastic. I have the Amped shirts which they don't sell anymore (I'm wearing one on my [home page](/)), but I know their newer shirts are just as good. You can shop for them [here](https://www.selkirk.com/collections/apparel). [The new TM brand](https://www.selkirk.com/collections/tm-brand) will be what I will grab next. Go get some for yourself!
