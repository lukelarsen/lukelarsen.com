## A Great Round Robin Battle

This week was the Utah State Campionship Round Robin tournament. This tournament can be a long one since it is a round robin. I like these tournaments because you get a lot of play time no matter how things go. I partnered up with Joe Zaleski and we played in the Men's 35+ 5.0 bracket. We played really well and didn't loose a match. Our second to last round was a super close one. Each round went to 21. We were down 13-19 but ended up winning 22-20. We played tough and got a nice run there at the end. Huzzah!
