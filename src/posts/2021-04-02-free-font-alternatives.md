## Free fonts can be okay
I am all for paying for a good font! However, sometimes you need a free font for a project. Many free fonts are not great, and when you go looking for free fonts the search can become painful. I've been in this spot before. I wasn't looking for a free font at the moment, but I saw [this blog](https://learnui.design/blog/ultimate-guide-similar-fonts.html) post come across my Twitter feed. It shows free alternatives for the most popular pro fonts. This post might come in handy when you start that next project.
