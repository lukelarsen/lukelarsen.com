## Converting px to rem
I've found [this tool](https://pixelsconverter.com/px-to-rem) to be quite useful when I just need a quick converstion to rem. For most of the applications I work on we have a modular scale built in that handles most of the sizing but sometimes I just need to convert a px from a design tool to it's rem equivelant. This tool is just for that. Keep in mind when using this you need to know what your base is set to to get an acurate result.
