## Court Bubbles

It's a sad day. It has been raining a lot, and we've got some bubbles appearing on the court. After some investigating, the people who installed the court have learned they should have acid washed the concrete before placing down the court material. The court surface needs to be pulled up now. Then the concrete can be properly acid washed. Once the concrete is washed, the court surface gets re-applied. The games and lessons will have to be put on hold for a little bit. We don't have to pay for the re-application we just have to wait for it to be complete.
