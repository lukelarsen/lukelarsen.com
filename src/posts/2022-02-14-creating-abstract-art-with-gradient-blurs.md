## Creating Abstract Art with Gradient Blurs

I've always enjoyed created abstract art with code or design tools. I remember a course I took in college where we had to create pieces of art and only use digital means. This was during a time where a lot of things were hand drawn or scanned in. It was a lot of fun to push the boundries with digital design tools. I still enjoy creating digial art today. Here are a few doodles I've made while blending together various shapes with different types of blur effects on them. I'm using [Pixelmator](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) to create these. I've drawn a few random shapes and them I'm applying the zoom blur to them and overlapping the shapes in interesting ways.
