## Playing Pickleball Just Got Easier

When we built this house, I was not interested in pickleball. We did have a large concrete slab poured on the side of the house because we didn't want to take care of a large yard, and we wanted a place to place basketball and other games. Once I fell in love with pickleball I knew we had to turn this space into a court. We found someone qualified to do the work and got started.

We use this court just about every day. My wife and I drill on it a lot. The kids have the neighbors over and they go at it as well. There is a tennis game called Olympic Tennis that I ran all the time back when I taught tennis that I've adapted to work for pickleball. The kids love this one with their friends. I explain how to play on a different post.

 We've been able to do some lessons and clinics here, and it has been great. All you locals are welcome to come to play or if you want a lesson let me know.
