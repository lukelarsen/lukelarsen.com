The Selkirk Labs 003 paddle is the third paddle to arrive on Selkirk Labs. For those not familiar with Selkirk Labs, it is a division of Selkirk Sport that allows the company to collaborate with players to fine-tune new paddles they are bringing to market. If you'd like to know more or use some of these paddles you can visit the [Selkirk Labs](https://www.selkirklabs.com/) website. Selkirk was kind enough to send me a demo of the 003 paddle in the Epic shape. Thanks Selkirk!

## The Thickest Paddle Ever
This paddle is 20mm thick making it the thickest paddle on the market. My initial reaction to this was that it would be a super control paddle since power paddles are typically thinner. Now that I'd had a chance to hit with it though I can say that that isn't true. This paddle is a power AND a control paddle. It is a really good balance. I'd say the Vanguard 2.0 paddles are control paddles while the Vanguard Power Air is a Power paddle and this one is right in the middle. 

## Spin
Oh man! The spin on this paddle is crazy. I can generate plenty of topspin on my dinks, drops, drives, and serves. The first time I played a game with this paddle the opposing team was getting mad because my serve would jump towards them after it bounced. 

## Coming From the Vanguard 2.0 Line
If you are like me and coming from the Vanguard 2.0 line this will be an easy switch. The 003 feels like a Vanguard 2.0 but with more spin and more power. With any paddle change, there is some adjustment time but I don't feel this will be long at all. As a long-time Vanguard player, I find this paddle to be a great evolution to a new level.

## A Note On Weight
When I first got this paddle it felt incredibly light. I added some lead tape around the edges until I was happy with the feel. This is a personal preference. You can add as much lead tape as you want until it feels comfortable. For me, the paddle feels even better with some added weight. 

## Durability
I've used this paddle in quite a few games over the past few weeks. I'm glad to see that Selkirk was able to keep the technology from the Vanguard 2.0 on the paddle face. I don't see any nicks in the sweet spot where there is repeated hitting.

## Overall
Selkirk has made a paddle to push the boundaries even farther giving players more spin and more power while not giving up on control. If you're a long-time Selkirk player who loves your control you will love the 003 paddle because it will give you more pop and more spin. If you've never used a Selkirk paddle before this paddle is a great place to start. If you're in my area shoot me a message and you can demo it!
