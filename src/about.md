## Who is this guy?

I’m a UX Designer and UI Engineer living in beautiful southern Utah. I enjoy designing and coding flexible interfaces for the web. I’m employed by Verizon Media where I craft tools for customers to manage their online video content. There are always unique problems to solve at work and I enjoy every minute of it. We are always looking for others to join the team so [reach out](mailto:luke@lukelarsen.com) if you’re looking for something new. 

When I’m not playing around with interfaces you can find me hanging out with my kids, on the Pickleball court, or spinning homemade ice cream.
